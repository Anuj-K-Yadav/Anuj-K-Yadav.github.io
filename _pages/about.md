I am an Undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical Enginerring at Indian Institute of Technology Patna. I am primarily interested in Research in Theoretical Computer Science and Communications.\\
My specific research Interests include: 
* Information and Coding Theory
* Information-theoretic Security and Privacy
* Cryptography
* Wireless Communications\\
I have been working under Prof. Amitalok Budkuley (IIT Kharagpur) on Information-theoretic security and cryptography for almost a year as of now. Currently, I am also working with Prof. Sudhan Majhi (IIT Patna) on OFDM systems.
