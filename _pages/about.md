Hi! I am currently a third-year B.Tech undergraduate @ Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna. My research interests are mainly in the areas of Deep Learning and Indoor Localisation (Wireless Ad-hoc netork). I am interested in designing efficient and effective neural models for Signal Processing.

I mainly work on applications involving real time Indoor Localisation in wireless Ad-hoc sensor network.
