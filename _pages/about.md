A Junior Year Student at IIT Patna, pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering and an inspired Machine Learning Researcher jaunting through different Research topics. \\
I want to understand things clearly. I believe there is some mathematical mystery behind the interpretation of what Deep Neural Networks learn and why they learn so. \\ 
I mostly work with sensor data in doing so, I face difficulty in applying a particular architecture on a test data which has a relatively different distribution than the training data (this problem is addressed called as Cold Start problem in literature), to tackle this I am exploring unsupervised methods that can solve this problem. \\
I like learning and implementing new deep learning architectures. Many times, new architectures just come to my mind, some of them work while many fail disastrously. However, I am still not capable to answer why a particular network architecture works on certain data, while it fails on others mathematically. \\
I am actively looking for research-based projects.  I am working under Dr. Sudhir Kumar (IIT Patna) for 3 years now. I have also worked in collaboration with Prof. Sajal Das (Missouri University).
