A Junior Year Student at IIT Patna, pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering and an inspired Machine Learning Researcher jaunting through different Research topics. I want to understand things clearly. I believe there is a mathematical mystery behind the interpretation of what Deep Neural Networks learn and why they learn so. I mostly work with sensor data in doing so, I mostly face difficulty in applying a particular architecture on a test data which has a relatively different distribution than the training data (this problem is addressed called as Cold Start problem in literature).
I like learning and implementing new deep learning architectures. Many times, new architectures just come to my mind, some of them work while many fail disastrously. However, I am still not capable to answer why a particular network architecture works on certain data, while it fails on others mathematically.
I am actively looking for research-based projects.  I am working under Dr. Sudhir Kumar (IIT Patna) for 3 years now. I have also worked in collaboration with Prof. Sajal Das (Missouri University).
In my first year, I developed a Hybrid Classifier for Sensor localization and this work got selected in ICDCN-2019 IISC Bangalore.
I also have experience with Competitive Programming. One can find my performance on various Competitive Programming sites like Codeforces, Codechef, and UVa (member handle - aquarius31). However, I have focused my attention on Research (that doesn’t mean I don’t care about Algo & DS, after all, it lies at the heart of ML).
In my sophomore year, I devoted time to hone my programming skills and learn few new tools/concepts including REST-APIs, Spring Framework, MongoDB - I learned these tools while completing Crio Summer of Doing - 2019, where I built the backend of "QEats App - a food ordering and delivery app ".
