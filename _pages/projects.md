* Estimation of Modelling and Channel Parameters for OFDM Signals
  * Mentor: Prof. Sudhan Majhi (IIT Patna)
  * Work: Studied the working of OFDM, multicarrier modulated system based on FFT/ IFFT processing, Cyclic prefix and
    zero padding and enables transmitting data at higher rates by overcoming Inter-symbol Interference.
    Working on the Estimation of Parameters such as Carrier frequency offset, Symbol Time offset, No. of subcarriers,
    Oversampling factor and CP length for the given dataset of OFDM symbols using Deep learning.



* Trajectory Design for UAV Aided Cellular Networks
  * Mentor: Prof. Preetam Kumar (IIT Patna)
  * Work: Worked on Trajectory design for single UAV based on maximizing the expected uplink sum rate 
    without the availability of user side information and channel parameters using Reinforcement
    learning by formulating it as a Markov decision process and applied the Deterministic policy gradient (DPG)
    algorithm to simulate the optimization problem.
   
   
   
* Design of 1KB DRAM using SPICE
  * Mentor: Prof. Jawar Singh (IIT Patna)
  * Work: Worked on the layout and operation of DRAM cell, including the charging & discharging mechanism, pre-charging
    circuit and the sense amplifier. Designed and Simulated a 1 KB DRAM using 1024 1-Transistor, 1-Capacitor memory 
    cells using logic gates for multiplexing and the sense and send amplifier in LTspice .
