## __[Shakespeare In Your Service](https://github.com/thebackpropogator/Shakespeare-In-Your-Service)__
* Made a 3-layered Character generation sequence model in Pytorch to generate poem based on initial phrase given by the user as input.
* The model is trained on Shakespeare’s famous poem - Sonnet, so that the generated poem has Shakespearean taste to it.

## __[Gender Predictor](https://github.com/thebackpropogator/Gender-Predictor)__
* Made a Many to One Sequence Model in Pytorch to predict the gender of the person, by taking the name of the person as input
* The model is a single layer RNN, which is trained on Indian, Arabic American names.

## __[Notes Seperator](https://github.com/dsciitpatna/Notes-Separator/tree/master/Models/Piyush)__
* An app for students of IIT Patna which can automatically detect whether a given image is of someone’s notes or not and will suggest you to delete them.
* Implemented different CNN architectures for classification.

## __[Crime Predictor](https://github.com/thebackpropogator/Crime-Predictor)__
* Project to Forecast crimes in the city of California using OSN dataset.
* Using various ML algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc) to see which one best fits the data most accurately.

## __[Celvika](https://github.com/thebackpropogator/Celvika)__
* Used the concept of LSTMs and RNNs to make a Real time primitive chatbot capable of doing conversation through GUI (like command line or shell).
* The bot is modeled using Tensorflow’s seq2seq module with attention. The architecture uses 3 layers which can be configured to be either LSTM or GRU based.
