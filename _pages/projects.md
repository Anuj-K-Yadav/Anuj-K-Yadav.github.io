## __[History Scrapper](https://github.com/aquarius31/History-Scrapper)__
* A Chrome extension which provides user with their Browsing history and summary.
* The aim is to deploy Deep Learning techniques to predict most likely site the user is going to visit.
* Built the backend of the extension using **Flask** framework in python.

## __[Notes Seperator](https://github.com/dsciitpatna/Notes-Separator/tree/master/Models/Piyush)__
* An app for students of IIT Patna which can automatically detect whether a given image is of someone’s notes or not and will suggest you to delete them.
* Implemented different CNN architectures for classification.

## __[Crime Predictor](https://github.com/aquarius31/Crime-Predictor)__
* Project to Forecast crimes in the city of California using OSN dataset.
* Using various ML algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc) to see which one best fits the data most accurately.

## __[Celvika](https://github.com/aquarius31/Celvika)__
* Used the concept of LSTMs and RNNs to make a Real time primitive chatbot capable of doing conversation through GUI (like command line or shell).
* The bot is modeled using Tensorflow’s seq2seq module with attention. The architecture uses 3 layers which can be configured to be either LSTM or GRU based.
