2018 was a year of many firsts. 

First foreign visit.

First blackout.

First tech interview.

First time living alone.

First time living in a city.

First internship.

First night out.

First workout.

First date.

First sushi.

First kiss.

First love.

First trip on my own.

First time writing for myself.

I've never really valued my life and death has never scared me. But I felt alive for the first time in 2018. I enjoyed being in the company of people whom I love and started appreciating the small things in life. I now have so much that I want to do, places that I want to visit and foods that I want to eat. I want to experience everything this world has to offer. I want to learn a lot and make good use of my limited time. 

It wasn't just the happy moments that made this year so special but it was the experiences, the good and the bad ones. Legally, you become an adult when you turn eighteen but it's your experiences that truly make you an adult. Thus, 2018 marked my foray into adulthood. What I've learned and experienced during this one year is more valuable to me than what I did before it.
  
2018 was a year of living. The first year of my life.
