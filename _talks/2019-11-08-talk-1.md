This meetup was held under ML/AI Meetup programme under Developer Student's Club - IIT Patna. My presentation was based on the topic - "d-vector approach for Speaker Diarization", where I basically discussed basics of d-vector extraction and it's implementation in speaker diarization. 
The presentation was followed by discussion on possible new techniques that can be implemented in this domain.
