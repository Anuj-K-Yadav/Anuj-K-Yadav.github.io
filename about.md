Hi! I'm **Piyush Tiwary**, a Sophomore at IIT Patna. I enjoy Competitive Programming and Machine Learning (specifically Deep Learning). Currently I am on track to improve my Coding skills. I am also looking for some cool projects involving CNNs or RNNs.

As far as Research is concerned, I am more inclined towards DL based research works. Till now I have worked under [Prof. Sudhir Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/ksudhiriitk/), *Assistant Professor in Electrical Engineering department, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna* and [Prof. Sajal K Das](https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/sdas/), *Professor and Daniel St. Clair Endowed Chair Department of Computer Science, Missouri University of Science and Technology Rolla*.

When not coding, I'm usually either watching television shows or reading novels.
